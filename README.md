# EqualityCheck

In this challenge, you must verify the equality of two different values given the parameters a and b.

Both the value and type of the parameters need to be equal. The possible types of the given parameters are:

Numbers

Strings

Booleans (false or true)

What have you learned so far that will permit you to do two different checks (value and type) with a single statement?

Implement a function that returns true if the parameters are equal, and false if they are not.

Examples

CheckEquality(1, true) ➞ false

// A number and a boolean: the value and type are different.

CheckEquality(0, "0") ➞ false

// A number and a string: the type is different.

CheckEquality(1,  1) ➞ true

// A number and a number: the type and value are equal.
